.Sh NAME
.Nm shmif_dumpbus
.Nd examine shmif bus contents
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl p Ar pcapfile
.Ar busfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility examines the bus of an
.Xr shmif 4
Ethernet interface.
The most useful feature is converting the bus to the
.Xr pcap 3
file format for later examination.
.Nm
itself is limited to displaying only very basic information about
each frame.
.Pp
.Nm
accepts the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width xxxpcapfilexxx
.It Fl h
Print bus header only and skip contents.
.It Fl p Ar pcapfile
Convert bus contents to the
.Xr pcap 3
format and write the result to
.Ar pcapfile .
The file
.Fl
signifies stdout.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Feed the busfile contents to pcap:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ shmif_dumpbus -p - busfile | tcpdump -r -
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pcap 3 ,
.Xr shmif 4 ,
.Xr tcpdump 8
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
does not lock the busfile and is best used for post-mortem analysis
of the bus traffic.
.Pp
The timestamp for each frame contains the sender's timestamp and
may not be monotonically increasing with respect to the frame order
in the dump.
